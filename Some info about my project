The lander successfully lands with a success rate of around 73%. Ideally in irl situations it would have to be near perfect😉
I would like to expand it to a 3d environment, but hardware limitations.....sigh😒
I had a hard time interpreting the failure situations, to see what could be improved. In a lot of cases, the lander wanted to just chill out a distance away from the landing zone.
